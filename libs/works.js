You can call it Fake Terminal because it will not give you what a real shell-like SSH gives you.",

Besides having the benefit of improving and expanding your knowledge, either general or in more specific areas, this style of game is designed so that the contestants have fun playing, and its main objective is to create discussion and healthy debate among participants. In fact it is not mandatory that Trivia winners have to get a prize and almost everyone is ok with that as their main objective is to have fun and learn at the same time. Trivia questions and answers can be adapted to any audience and can be used in schools and universities to assist in language skills development and to test knowledge and skills levels.",
